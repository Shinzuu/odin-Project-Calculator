1. Initialize variables:
   - currentValue = 0 (represents the current value displayed on the calculator)
   - storedValue = null (to store the previous value for calculations)
   - operator = null (to store the current operator being used)

2. Define functions for handling button clicks:

   a. Function handleNumberClick(number):
      - Append the clicked number to the currentValue displayed on the calculator.
      - Update the display to show the new currentValue.

   b. Function handleOperatorClick(operator):
      - If operator is already set, calculate the result using the previous operator.
      - Store the currentValue as the storedValue.
      - Store the clicked operator.
      - Clear the currentValue for entering the next number.

   c. Function handleEqualClick():
      - Calculate the result using the storedValue, operator, and currentValue.
      - Update the display to show the result.

   d. Function handleClear():
      - Reset all variables to their initial values.
      - Update the display to show 0.

3. Set up event listeners for button clicks:
   - Add event listeners to number buttons to call handleNumberClick() with the clicked number.
   - Add event listeners to operator buttons to call handleOperatorClick() with the clicked operator.
   - Add event listener to the equal button to call handleEqualClick().
   - Add event listener to the clear button to call handleClear().

4. Update the display:
   - Create a function updateDisplay(value) to update the display with the given value.
   - Call updateDisplay() whenever the display needs to be updated, such as after button clicks or calculations.

5. Handle calculations:
   - Implement logic inside handleEqualClick() to perform calculations based on the storedValue, operator, and currentValue.
   - Implement error handling for invalid inputs or divide by zero scenarios.

6. Test the calculator:
   - Test various arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - Test edge cases such as dividing by zero, handling large numbers, etc.

7. Refactor and optimize code as needed.
